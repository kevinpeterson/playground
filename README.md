# Hacked Deep Playground

A hacked version of [Tensorflow Playground](http://playground.tensorflow.org/) that allows data sets from the file system to be run.

Build web app:
```npm install```
then
```npm run build```

Run the server:
```npm run serve```

Change the port:
PORT=xxxx npm run serve


Data files in the ```data``` directory will be automatically loaded.
